We decided to create a broadcasting system to allow a user to broadcast a message across mutliple distribution groups.
Any member who is subscribed to one of the distribution groups will receive the message.
The messages sent can be designated as confidential, public, private, or secret. 
The graphical user interface was designed to help the user experience.
It is compatible on both phone and pc formats.

This broadcasting system provides and intuitive and efficient way to safely transmit messages across multiple parties.
Our team name is SUB because it is analagous to a submarine, which can go to deeper sea levels, demonstrating the depth of the subscriber's ranking. 
For instance, the team leader is at a deeper level than the team members, who are one level above the team leader.
